# \## Usage (TODO)

# 

# > \*\*Note\*\*  

# > This project uses PlatformIO in VSCode.  

# >  

# > To flash a board:

# > 1. Hold the \*\*BOOTSEL\*\* button (momentary button next to the USB port) while plugging in your USB cable.

# > 2. When in bootloader mode, the board will show up as a flash drive named `RPI-RP2`.

# > 3. Drag the `.uf2` file from the `build/` folder onto the drive.

# > 4. It will disconnect, reboot, and start running your code.
