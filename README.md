# > To flash a board, hold the boot select button (momentary button next to the USB port) while plugging in your USB cable. When the board is properly connected and in bootloader mode, it should show up as a flash drive named RPI-RP2 on your computer. Drag the .uf2 file from the build folder onto the drive and it will disconnect, restart, and start executing your code.
